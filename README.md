A material(-ish) minesweeper

This is the repository for the app I am developing. The aim is to create the classic minesweeper game with a bold intentinal look using the material design concept. Also I am streaming this on livecoding.tv 

Take a look at [this link](https://www.livecoding.tv/dasheck0/videos/) for the latest livestream of this project.
